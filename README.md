<p align="center">An <em>intentionally insecure</em> web application to highlight different web security concepts</p>

---

This is an example application used by [Dominik Kundel](https://github.com/dkundel) in his [Introduction to Web Security talk](https://github.com/dkundel/intro-web-security). It has intenionally a [set of vulnerabilities](#vulnerabilities) to highlight different attack vectors and as well as ways to fix them.

If you find any additional attack vectors, feel free to create an issue for it or alternatively create a pull request for this README to add it to the [list of vulnerabilities](#vulnerabilities).

## Vulnerabilities
There is a variety of vulnerabilites present in this application. Check out the respective docs to learn more about them.
